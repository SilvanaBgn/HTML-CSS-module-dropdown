# Motivation

I wanted to create a dropdown only using pure HTML and CSS. When you work hard to avoid importing additional libraries or JS code that is not entirely necessary, finally it improves the performance of your application. Imagine reducing the amount of lines/files, the depth of the HTML tree, using JS code only when needed or more efficient. A sum of small improvements that ultimately means a faster application.
